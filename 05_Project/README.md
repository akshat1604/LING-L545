# Project

# Introduction: 
The Clinical Text Summarizer project represents an innovative effort in the field of
Computational Linguistics, aiming to provide succinct and informative summaries of
clinical texts, which are often complex and densely packed with crucial information.
This project leverages the TextRank algorithm with a novel twist to adapt to the unique
characteristics of clinical narratives, where sentence order may not necessarily follow
a sequential pattern.

# Approach
1. Text Preprocessing: The initial step involves text preprocessing, where I clean
and tokenize the clinical text, removing noise and irrelevant information. This
ensures that the subsequent steps are based on a structured and clean founda-
tion.
2. Named Entity Recognition (NER): Named Entity Recognition is a vital com-
ponent of this project. It involves the identification of entities within the clini-
cal text, such as diseases, medications, procedures, and patient demographics.
NER is essential in establishing the foundation for entity-centric summariza-
tion.
3. Relation Extraction Model Training: To capture the relationships between en-
tities, I will train a custom relation extraction model. This model identifies
connections and associations between entities, enabling us to build a com-
prehensive understanding of the clinical textâ€™s content. It allows for a more
context-aware representation of information.
4. Graph Construction: Instead of considering sentences as nodes, this project
employs a more advanced approach. Entities identified through NER are treated
as nodes, and edges are created based on the relationships extracted in the pre-
vious step. This entity-centric graph forms the backbone of the summarization
process.
5. PageRank Algorithm: To rank the importance of entities within the constructed
graph, we apply the PageRank algorithm. PageRank takes into account both
the quantity and quality of relationships an entity has, making it a powerful tool
for identifying the most significant elements in the clinical narrative. Gulati V

6. Summary Generation: The final step involves selecting the top-k ranked en-
tities and using their associated information to generate a coherent summary.
This entity-centric approach ensures that the summary is not only concise but
also contextually relevant, providing a comprehensive understanding of the
original clinical text.
# Dataset
I will be utilizing the i2b2/VA challenge on concepts, assertions, and relations in clin-
ical text dataset for training the model.
# Significance
This project addresses the challenge of summarizing clinical narratives, which are
known for their complexity and irregular structure. By focusing on entities and
their relationships, my approach goes beyond conventional extractive summarization
methods, offering summaries that are tailored to the specific content and context of
clinical texts. The resulting system has the potential to assist medical professionals,
researchers, and other stakeholders in quickly accessing and understanding critical
information in clinical documents, ultimately contributing to improved patient care
and medical research.
# Conclusion

By adapting the TextRank algorithm to an entity-centric approach, my implemen-
tation overcomes the challenges posed by non-sequential clinical narratives. This
project has the potential to streamline information retrieval and decision-making in
the medical domain, serving as a valuable tool for the healthcare industry and research
community.
